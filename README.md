# Book-Swapper
Book Exchange Platform / Web Application

1. Introduction:
Target Users for this application are Book reading Enthusiasts. These Enthusiasts has to spend lot of money purchasing books, as scope for knowledge gaining though book reading is end-less. One way these enthusiasts can save money is by exchanging books with their neighbors. But this methodology has limitations. These limitations include but not limited to-
1) neighbors may not have a book that interests a Book Reader.
2) neighbors might not be willing to swap their Books.
Clearly, to overcome these limitations, we need a System, that bring all Book Readers (who are willing to swap their Books with each other) together.
This application ‘Book Swapper’ exactly addresses above mentioned limitations, which brings Book Reading enthusiasts together. As a result users are left with large number of reading options, without spending extra money.
